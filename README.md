# GeneNetworkAPI

Provides access to the [GeneNetwork](http://genenetwork.org) database
and analysis functions using the [GeneNetwork REST
API](https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-docs/blob/master/api/GN2-REST-API.md).

Karl Broman wrote the
[GNapi](https://github.com/kbroman/GNapi/blob/main/README.md) R
package for providing access to GeneNetwork from R.  This package
follows th structure and function of that package closely.
